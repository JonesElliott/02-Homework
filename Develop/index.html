            <p>
                I am a student enrolled in the UCSD extension bootcamp for coding and web development. My journey started as a self taught programmer dabbling in game development but always hit road blocks in my learning. Teaching one's self anything is tough, but programming especially so. I never let those road blocks stay closed for long though. I set a goal for myself to complete one project regardless if I was completely satisfied with the end result or not. Completing that project helped me gain more confidence and opened up a new path for me in my programming ventures. With my new found confidence I decided it was time to enroll myself in school to turn my hobby into a career.

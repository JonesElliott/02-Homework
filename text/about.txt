I am a student enrolled in the UCSD extension bootcamp for coding
and web development. My journey started as a self taught
programmer dabbling in game development but always hit road blocks
in my learning. Teaching one's self anything is tough, but
programming especially so. I never let those road blocks stay
closed for long though. I set a goal for myself to complete one
project regardless if I was completely satisfied with the end
result or not. Completing that project helped me gain more
confidence and opened up a new path for me in my programming
ventures. With my new found confidence I decided it was time to
enroll myself in school to turn my hobby into a career.

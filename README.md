# My Portfolio
[Deployed Site](https://joneselliott.github.io/Portfolio/)

## Description
This is a portfolio page to let visitors know who I am and showcase my skills and projects. This site includes 3 pages, About Me, Portfolio, and a Contact page. All areas of the page are modular to fit scaling window sizes.

About me page features a beautiful picture of my handsome face and a summary of how I got into programming and where I am today.
Portfolio page is where I will showcase all my future projects in and outside of the UCSD Coding Bootcamp course.
Contact page allows anyone to contact me about potential coding or programming opportunites, and of course fan mail.

## Usage
The navigation bar displays at the top of each page and allows the user to access each page of the website. Clicking my name (Elliott Jones) or About Me brings the user to the same About/Home Page.

The portfolio page will later be expanded and inlude links to all of my projects but is currently occupied with placeholder images.

The contact page allows the user to enter their name, email address, and a short message. Once submit is clicked, it will open up the users default email client and populate my email to continue sending me mail.

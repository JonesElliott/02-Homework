Homework 02 - Responsive Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio page to let visitors know who I am and showcase my skills and projects. This site includes 3 pages, About Me, Portfolio, and a Contact page. These pages were built using HTML with semantic elements and Bootstrap classes. All areas of the page are modular to fit scaling window sizes.

About me page features a beautiful picture of my handsome face and a summary of how I got into programming and where I am today.
Portfolio page is where I will showcase all my future projects in and outside of the UCSD Coding Bootcamp course.
Contact page allows anyone to contact me about potential opportunites related to code, and fan mail.
